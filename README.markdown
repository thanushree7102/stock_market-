Stock Market Analysis 
The Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting System is designed to analyze historical stock market data and predict future stock prices using advanced time-series models. It leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns, employs models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM for forecasting, and provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualizing data insights and predictions. This project aims to assist investors and analysts in making data-driven decisions.
